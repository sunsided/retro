//! This module provides the [`WgpuState`] struct and its associated implementation for managing
//! WebGPU state within a Rust application. It abstracts over the low-level WebGPU API to
//! simplify tasks such as creating surfaces, configuring devices, handling window resizing,
//! and submitting command buffers to the GPU.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The [`WgpuState`] struct is designed to handle core WebGPU initialization and management tasks,
//! including creating a suitable adapter, device, and queue, as well as configuring surfaces for
//! rendering. This abstraction makes it easier to manage the GPU rendering lifecycle in modern
//! applications that use the `wgpu` and `winit` crates.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Creates and manages a WebGPU instance, adapter, device, queue, and surface.
//! - Configures the surface with optimal settings for rendering.
//! - Handles window resizing by reconfiguring the surface appropriately.
//! - Provides utility methods to poll the device and submit command buffers for rendering.
//!
//! # Structs
//!
//! - `WgpuState`: The main struct of this module. It wraps and manages WebGPU objects
//!   such as the `Instance`, `Surface`, `Adapter`, `Device`, and `Queue`.
//!
//! # References
//!
//! For more details about the underlying WebGPU API, see the [wgpu documentation](https://docs.rs/wgpu).
